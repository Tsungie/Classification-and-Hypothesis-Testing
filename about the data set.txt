Customers who show interest in these offerings are termed as leads.

Customers are found in 3 ways: 

The customer interacts with the marketing front on social media or other online platforms.
The customer browses the website/app and downloads the brochure
The customer connects through emails for more information.
The company then nurtures these leads and tries to convert them to paid customers. For this, the representative from the organisation connects with the lead on call or through email to share further details.
